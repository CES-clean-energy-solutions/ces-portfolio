  "shortDescription": "Full-discipline MEP modeling with integrated digital workflows for energy, sustainability, and certification.",
  "longDescription": "Our MEP engineering team delivers coordinated building services design through a fully digital BIM workflow — from IFC-based data exchange into Revit through to clash-free construction documentation. We integrate energy simulation, sustainability certification support, and building physics into every model stage, enabling truly integrated design across HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection disciplines. Our digital methods ensure that sustainability targets, regulatory compliance, and performance optimization are embedded in the model — not bolted on afterward.",
