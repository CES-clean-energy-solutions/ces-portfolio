  "longDescription": "Our CFD engineers operate across macro, meso, and micro scales — from regional wind climate downscaling through urban district airflow to room-level interior comfort analysis. We use OpenFOAM with urbanMicroclimateFoam, the coupled multi-physics solver developed at the ETH Zurich Chair of Building Physics, to model turbulent airflow, heat and moisture transport, and radiation exchange simultaneously. Urban wind comfort is assessed against Lawson criteria with velocity ratio mapping and 3D streamline visualisation, while interior studies couple CFD results with energy simulation for holistic building performance evaluation.",
