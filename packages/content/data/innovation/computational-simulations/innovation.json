  "shortDescription": "CFD, FEA, thermal, and acoustic simulations for engineering precision.",
  "longDescription": "Our simulation engineers run high-fidelity computational models — from airflow and structural stress to daylighting and acoustics — to predict performance before construction begins. Every simulation is calibrated against real-world measurements, giving clients confidence that the built outcome will match the design intent.",
